making items for donators...
~~//\\//~~


ItemAssistant, find this method:


public void getRequirements(String itemName, int itemId) {


The first line should handle the levelReq variables.

Simply add on to it, the following.


c.donorReq


It should look similar to the following.


c.donorReq = c.attackLevelReq = c.prayerLevelReq = c.hitpointsLevelReq = c.defenceLevelReq = c.strengthLevelReq = c.rangeLevelReq = c.magicLevelReq = 0;


Note, I have added more variables to mine, so yours probably will be different.

Now, let's scroll down some, and set the requirements.
You have an option of doing it by item ID, or by name.

Here is by ID (Should already be in your source)


                        case 11724:
                        case 11726:
                        case 11728:
                                c.defenceLevelReq = 65;
                                c.donorReq = 1;
                        break;


We simply add the c.donorReq to the item.

You now need 65 defence, and donorReq to wear the item.

Now, let's find


public boolean wearItem(int wearID, int slot) {


Scroll down some until you see this.


if(Config.itemRequirements) {


Under that, add this:


                                                if(c.donorReq > 0) {
                                                        if(YOUR_DONOR_VARIABLE) < c.donorReq) {
                                                                c.sendMessage("You must be a donator to wear that item.");
                                                                canWearItem = false;
                                                        }
                                                }


Now, go to the Player class, and declare.


public int donorReq;
